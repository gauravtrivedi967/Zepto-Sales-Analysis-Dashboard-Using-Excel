# Zepto-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard-Using-Excel

This repository contains the code and documentation for a **Sales Dashboard** created as part of my coursework. The dashboard provides comprehensive insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and outlet ratings, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions in a retail context.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The Sales Dashboard is an interactive tool designed to visualize key business metrics and trends. It is organized into multiple sections that cover:

- **Total Sales & Average Sales**: Displays overall revenue and average transaction size.
- **Number of Orders & Average Rating**: Shows total order count and average customer ratings across outlets.
- **Sales by Outlet Establishment**: Year-over-year sales comparison, helping to identify growth patterns.
- **Fat Content & Sales by Item Type**: Breakdown of product categories by fat content and item type.
- **Sales by Outlet**: Sales comparison between different outlet locations.
- **Sales by Outlet Size**: Insights into performance based on outlet size (small, medium, large).
- **Outlet Type**: Analyzes sales, average sales, and order quantities by outlet type, such as supermarkets and grocery stores.
- **Rating vs. Number of Orders**: Visualizes customer satisfaction in relation to order volume.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Filter Panel**: Allows users to filter data based on outlet size, location, establishment year, and item type.
- **Data Visualizations**: Includes bar charts, pie charts, and line charts for easy data interpretation.
- **Interactive Design**: Users can select filters to dynamically update and view specific data segments.

## 🖥️ Tech Stack
